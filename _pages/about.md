ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m an artificial intelligence researcher specializing in computer vision and machine learning. With a passion for solving complex problems, Iâ€™ve dedicated 3+ years to medical AI, particularly in the field of computational pathology. Additionally, I have 7+ years of experience in event-based vision, focusing on event cameras.

`Industry Experience`
As a Senior Research Scientist and Team Leader at [Lunit](https://www.lunit.io)â€™s Oncology AI group, Iâ€™ve been at the forefront of driving progress. Our collaborative efforts have led to prestigious awards, impactful research papers, and even a patent. Though our team was titled model-centric, I further thrive on exploring data-centric, and engineering-centric approaches to advance the field.

`Academic Journey`
During my Ph.D. research at [GIST](https://www.gist.ac.kr/en/main.html) (and [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/)), I deeply explored many exciting applications of[ event cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_camera) (event-based-vision). My work spanned areas such as image reconstruction, super-resolution, and stereo depth estimation. Recognized at top conferences, my findings have been published in esteemed journals.

`My Mission`
My north star is enhancing business efficiency and ensuring sustainable growth in every project I undertake. I am passionate about contributing to AI for humanitarian causes, working to save lives, alleviate suffering, and uphold human dignity.

Feel free to explore my [CV](/cv/), [GitHub](https://github.com/smmmmi) and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NNvELCcAAAAJ) profiles for more details about my research and contributions.
