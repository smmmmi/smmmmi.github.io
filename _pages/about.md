👋 Hello! I’m an artificial intelligence researcher with over a decade of experience in computer vision and machine learning. Driven by a passion for tackling complex problems, my work spans diverse areas including diffusion models and GANs for image-to-image translation, medical AI with a focus on computational pathology, and event-based vision leveraging event cameras. You can explore my latest interests [here](/cv/#interests-1), and/or keep reading for a concise overview about me.

`Current Affiliations`

(1) I am a postdoctoral researcher at Seoul National University (SNU) [Machine Perception and Reasoning lab](https://snumprlab.github.io/people.html) Since Apr. 2024. I collaborate mostly on event-based vision research, image-to-image translation research involving diffusion and consistency models.

(2)  In addition, I am affiliated with two institutes under South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT through the [InnoCORE](https://www.msit.go.kr/eng/bbs/view.do?sCode=eng&mId=4&mPid=2&pageIndex=&bbsSeqNo=42&nttSeqNo=1128&searchOpt=ALL&searchTxt=innocore) (Innovation + Core Researchers) program: Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology (DGIST) Bio-Embodied Physical AI Research Group [Computer vision lab](https://cvlab.dgist.ac.kr/projects/), and Korea Advnaced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) [Visual Intelligence lab](https://vi.kaist.ac.kr).

`Back to Academia after Industry`
I was a nomadic postdoc researcher position at Medical Imaging and Signal Processing Research Center [MISP](https://misp.mui.ac.ir/) at the Medical University of Isfahan, Iran. This project is held by Iran's National Elites Foundation [INEF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%27s_National_Elites_Foundation) conducted via the [Connect Platform](https://connect.isti.ir/). In addition to developing CV/ML data and deep learning project that are mainly focused on medical AI, I design and teach AI courses to medical students and professors to foster interdisciplinary research teams.

`Industry Experience after PhD`
As a Senior Research Scientist and Team Leader at [Lunit](https://www.lunit.io)’s Oncology AI group, I’ve been at the forefront of driving progress. Our collaborative efforts have led to prestigious awards, impactful research papers, and even a patent. Though our team was titled model-centric, I further thrive on exploring data-centric, and engineering-centric approaches to advance the field.

`Academic Journey`
During my Ph.D. research at [GIST](https://www.gist.ac.kr/en/main.html) (and [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/)), I deeply explored many exciting applications of[ event cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_camera) (event-based-vision). My work spanned areas such as image reconstruction, super-resolution, and stereo depth estimation. Recognized at top conferences, my findings have been published in esteemed journals.

`My Mission`
My north star is enhancing business efficiency and ensuring sustainable growth in every project I undertake. I am passionate about contributing to AI for humanitarian causes, working to save lives, alleviate suffering, and uphold human dignity.
