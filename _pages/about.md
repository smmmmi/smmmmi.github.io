ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m an artificial intelligence researcher specializing in computer vision and machine learning. With a passion for solving complex problems, Iâ€™ve dedicated 3+ years to medical AI, particularly in the field of computational pathology. Additionally, I have 7+ years of experience in event-based vision, focusing on event cameras. Explore my latest interests [here](/cv/#interests-1), and/or keep reading for a concise overview about me.

`Current Affiliations`

(1) I am a postdoc researcher (Since Sep. 2025) at Korea Advnaced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) [Visual Intelligence lab](https://vi.kaist.ac.kr). Conducted in collaboration with my 2nd affiilation, SNUMPR, this research is supported by South Koreaâ€™s Ministry of Science and ICT through the InnoCORE (Innovation + Core Researchers) program.

(2) I am a postdoc researcher (Since Apr. 2024) at Seoul National University (SNU) [Machine Perception and Reasoning lab](https://snumprlab.github.io/people.html). I collaborate on event-based vision research, image-to-image translation research involving diffusion and consistency models, and also versatile incremental learning.


`Back to Academia after Industry`
I was a nomadic postdoc researcher position at Medical Imaging and Signal Processing Research Center [MISP](https://misp.mui.ac.ir/) at the Medical University of Isfahan, Iran. This project is held by Iran's National Elites Foundation [INEF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%27s_National_Elites_Foundation) conducted via the [Connect Platform](https://connect.isti.ir/). In addition to developing CV/ML data and deep learning project that are mainly focused on medical AI, I design and teach AI courses to medical students and professors to foster interdisciplinary research teams.

`Industry Experience after PhD`
As a Senior Research Scientist and Team Leader at [Lunit](https://www.lunit.io)â€™s Oncology AI group, Iâ€™ve been at the forefront of driving progress. Our collaborative efforts have led to prestigious awards, impactful research papers, and even a patent. Though our team was titled model-centric, I further thrive on exploring data-centric, and engineering-centric approaches to advance the field.

`Academic Journey`
During my Ph.D. research at [GIST](https://www.gist.ac.kr/en/main.html) (and [KAIST](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/)), I deeply explored many exciting applications of[ event cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_camera) (event-based-vision). My work spanned areas such as image reconstruction, super-resolution, and stereo depth estimation. Recognized at top conferences, my findings have been published in esteemed journals.

`My Mission`
My north star is enhancing business efficiency and ensuring sustainable growth in every project I undertake. I am passionate about contributing to AI for humanitarian causes, working to save lives, alleviate suffering, and uphold human dignity.
